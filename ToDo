make atlist 2 threads for the rendering, one for making the image, and one for rendering the bitmap onto the screen
And have them work side by side at once

tank with good player input
- implement the key up and down code

random map layout and sizes

implement good physics

way later make threads to take care of the player input events so it dosent interfeir with the deltaTime

make a compute shader that renders the image
